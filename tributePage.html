      Profile of Narendra Modi (favourite politician)
    </h2>
    <p class="para">
      Born on the 17th. Modi was born in September 1950 to a grocery family in Wadnagar in Mehsana district. He grew up
      in a small town in northern Gujarat and completed his masters in political science at the University of Gujarat in
      Ahmedabad. He was the third of six children of Damodardas Mulchand and Hiraben Modi. As a child, Modi helped his
      father sell tea at Vadnagar railway station and later he and his brother ran a tea stall near the bus stand. He
      completed his secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967.

      How did Narendra Modi become a politician?
      In the early 1970s, he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a pro-Hindu organisation, and formed a unit
      of the student wing of the RSS, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in his district. Modi climbed up the hierarchy
      of the SSR and his ties with this organization greatly benefited his later political career.

      Narendra Modi – a political leader I admire
      He has become the CM of Gujarat and makes everyone happy, makes many successful programmers and helps people to
      believe him. He works very hard, he always gets up at 4am and does yoga so he doesn’t forget his culture. He also
      holds all the meetings and delivers Narendra Modi’s speech. He never looks tired, he does his job very well. Other
      countries are also inviting him and want to work with him. It promoted tourism and relations with other peoples.
      Narendra Modi’s speech is usually too surprising when it comes to national celebrations.

      Why is Narendra Modi my favourite politician?
      Modi has created many jobs for the unemployed in India. And now he is all set to take India a step further by
      making the internet available everywhere, for which he has willingly joined hands with Google and Facebook. He
      also uses Twitter, which is a powerful way to connect with people. He also encourages all athletes and soldiers.
      He does almost all the celebrations with the Indian army.

      He sat on the example that anyone can do anything, all it takes is a strong will to do it. And he is the best
      example of that. He started his career as the son of a tea salesman and has now become the country’s prime
      minister. He loves his mother very much and always bows to her.

      ModesCampaigns
      Modi has also helped many farmers and other poor people in India, he has almost solved the water problem in India,
      he is also very good at building the infrastructure of India. He has now launched the Make in India programme. It
      allows us to do things in India and not use foreign products, so we can take advantage of it and make India one of
      the greatest countries. He says if you take one step forward, think 125 million feet if you take one step forward,
      then no one can stop us from moving forward. That’s why Narendra Modi is my favorite politician.

      He is the greatest son of Mother India.
